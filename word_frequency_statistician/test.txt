Abstract

Recent advances in machine learning have significantly improved the performance of natural language processing (NLP) systems. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning architecture that integrates contextual embeddings with a transformer-based model to enhance the accuracy of text classification tasks. We evaluate our proposed model on several benchmark datasets, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art models, achieving up to a 5% increase in F1 score across various datasets. Moreover, we analyze the computational efficiency of our approach and show that it can be trained and deployed more effectively than existing models while maintaining high accuracy. This work contributes to the field by offering a practical solution for enhancing the robustness of NLP systems in real-world applications.
