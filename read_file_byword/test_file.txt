The Last Light of Summer

In the small town of Willowbrook, where the trees whispered secrets and the river sang lullabies, there lived an old man named Thomas. He was known as the keeper of the last light of summer—a lantern that glowed with a warm, golden hue, said to ward off the chill of autumn.

Every year, on the first day of September, Thomas would light the lantern and carry it through the streets. The townsfolk would follow him, their faces lit by the flickering flame, until they reached the edge of the forest. There, beneath the ancient oak tree, they would gather around and share stories of summers past.

This year, however, Thomas felt his age. His hands trembled as he lit the lantern, and his steps were slow. The townspeople noticed but said nothing, knowing that Thomas would speak when he was ready.

As the lantern’s glow illuminated the clearing, Thomas cleared his throat. “My friends,” he began, “this may be my last summer with you. I have kept this lantern burning for many years, but it is time for someone else to carry on the tradition.”

A hush fell over the crowd. Thomas had always been a constant presence in their lives, a symbol of the enduring warmth of summer against the encroaching cold.

“I’ve chosen young Lily to take my place,” Thomas continued. Lily, a bright-eyed girl of twelve, stepped forward, her face flushed with excitement and a hint of nervousness.

Thomas handed her the lantern, its warmth spreading from his hands to hers. “Remember, Lily,” he said, his voice soft, “the light within this lantern is not just for guiding us through the dark. It’s also a reminder that even as the seasons change, the warmth of our memories can keep us company.”

With that, the townsfolk cheered, and Lily carried the lantern back into the heart of Willowbrook, where it would shine brightly for one more year. And though Thomas watched from his porch, feeling the weight of his years, he knew that the light would continue to guide them all through the coming seasons.
